# Monad Invaders

## Description:

A Space Invaders arcade game clone written in Haskell using [HELM](http://helm-engine.org/) framework

## How to build and run:

cabal configure && cabal build
then execute a run.sh script 

## Contribution: 

Sourcecode doesn't contain any monads exept IO -- only applicatives are in use, so more appropriate name for a project is required.

No major styling desision was accepred -- so concepts of spaceships, invaders, backgrounds, etc. are welcome!
